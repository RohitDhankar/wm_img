-- The second core thing that PyTorch provides is the
ability of tensors to keep track of the operations performed on them and to analyti-
cally compute derivatives of an output of a computation with respect to any of its
inputs. This is used for numerical optimization, and it is provided natively by tensors
by virtue of dispatching through PyTorchâ€™s autograd engine under the hood.
