Whats PyTorch ? Why PyTorch ? some bits of theory before the Code :)

- 3. The second core thing that PyTorch provides is the ability of tensors to keep track of the operations performed on them and to analytically compute >> derivatives of an output >> of a computation with respect to any of its inputs. This is used for numerical optimization, and it is provided natively by tensors by virtue of dispatching through PyTorch’s autograd engine under the hood.

- 4. The core PyTorch modules for building neural networks are located in torch.nn , which provides common neural network layers and other architectural components. 
Fully connected layers, convolutional layers, activation functions, and loss functions can all be found here (we’ll go into more detail about what all that means as we go through the rest of this book).

- 5. First we need to physically get the data, most often from some sort of storage as the data source. Then we need to convert each sample from our data into a something PyTorch can actually handle: tensors. 
This bridge between our custom data (in whatever format it might be) and a standardized PyTorch tensor is the Dataset class PyTorch provides in torch.utils.data . 
As this process is wildly different from one problem to the next, we will have to implement this data sourcing ourselves. We will look in detail at how to represent various type of data we might want to work with as tensors in chapter 4.
